## Introduction

Yusen Logistics is an intermediary between the shipper and the carrier, tasked with bridging the needs of both parties and assuming continuous responsibility throughout the transportation process.

It is a subsidiary of a parent company headquartered in Japan.

The company needs to develop a new customer acquisition policy with price purchase and selling price as the focal points.


### Annotation

- Buy, Sell: purchase price from the shipping carrier and selling price to customers accordingly.
- HAWB, MAWB: HAWB (House Airway Bill) is the bill of lading code for each shipment within an MAWB (Master Airway Bill). HAWB is issued by the forwarder and HAWB is issued by the carrier.
- Volume Weight (VW): weight calculated based on dimensions.
- Gross Weight (GW): weight calculated including the weight of packaging and products.
- Chargeable Weight (CW): CW will be the higher value when comparing VW to GW of the good and is the weight used to calculate airfreight charges.

## Volume

In March-April, the total VW is generally higher than the GW of the shipments, indicating that businesses often use the VW number as a basis to calculate CW fees for the orders. This suggests that the majority of the business's shipments are lightweight goods.

--

The total CW on a daily and monthly basis is unstable, with large fluctuations, with an average value ranging from 31,000 to 32,000 kg. The situation is similar for the quantity of goods.

--

The total chargeable weight in April has decreased (equivalent to approximately 23%) compared to March.

![Picture4](https://github.com/antrinh1307/Power-BI-Project---Air-Export-Summary-of-a-Forwarder-March---April-2023-/assets/152482228/990fb4f2-8e9c-43ad-9bfa-36afcaf7e8bb)

--

In addition, the business regularly engages in consolidation activities. Close to 80% of the business's shipments are consolidation ones.

![Picture5](https://github.com/antrinh1307/Power-BI-Project---Air-Export-Summary-of-a-Forwarder-March---April-2023-/assets/152482228/1c8e404f-da15-4c7e-b831-440af8a17fe6)

--

To be able to consolidate, the shipments must have the same destination and a similar deadline, and they should not involve special types of goods.

#### => The purpose is to minimize transportation costs.

## Profit

The total revenue generated is approximately $4.6 million, while the costs account for only around $3.2 million. This indicates that in the last month of the first quarter and the first month of the second quarter, the profit reached $1.4 million, equivalent to a profit margin of 43.75%.

![Picture6](https://github.com/antrinh1307/Power-BI-Project---Air-Export-Summary-of-a-Forwarder-March---April-2023-/assets/152482228/0cf55b26-21cc-4d35-8639-da3ed3fc6cff)

#### => We can observe that the revenue of the operation primarily depends on the value of the chargeable weight (CW). In other words, the higher the CW achieved, the higher the revenue generated.

--

The business operations showed positive results in the early stage of March, reaching its peak in the middle of the month when the revenue reached approximately $181,000.

![Picture7](https://github.com/antrinh1307/Power-BI-Project---Air-Export-Summary-of-a-Forwarder-March---April-2023-/assets/152482228/2c9327e7-376e-4f67-af61-b42eb475789b)

However, after reaching its peak, the revenue tends to decline over a period of more than one month. Specifically, in the third week of April, the revenue officially hit its lowest point in two months, reaching approximately $45,800, which is only 25% (reduced from $181,000 to $45,800) compared to the peak in March. However, it experienced a strong recovery in the last week of April due to the increased demand for early shipments to avoid congestion during the holiday period of April 30th - May 1st.

--

The top 5 major customers, including SDVN, SHWS, SEOV, YHV QN, and FHBP, have the greatest influence by contributing over 50% to the total revenue. Other metrics such as the number of completed orders, volume of shipments, actual weight, etc., also hold a significant proportion, ranging from 10-20% of the overall figures. However, in terms of profitability, YHV HP has surpassed FHBP to make it into the top 5 with a profit margin of 4.17%.

## Shipper

The top 6 regular customers based on the number of completed orders are SHWS, SDVN, CVN, YHV QN, Paloma, and Meiko.

![Picture11](https://github.com/antrinh1307/Power-BI-Project---Air-Export-Summary-of-a-Forwarder-March---April-2023-/assets/152482228/34581003-f58f-4508-9e9f-fecfd316d18a)

--

Considering the volume factor, the group of 6 customers with large volumes includes FBHP, SHWS, SDVN, SEOV, YHV QN, and CVN.

![Picture12](https://github.com/antrinh1307/Power-BI-Project---Air-Export-Summary-of-a-Forwarder-March---April-2023-/assets/152482228/9c1232de-1ba0-4aa1-a1f8-a159140ea54d)

--

We can observe that there is no similarity between the regular customers and their respective volumes.

#### => Although some customers have a large number of orders, not all of them tend to have a preference for orders with a large chargeable weight (CW).

The conclusion above has an impact on the list of the top 6 customers that generate significant profits for the business. Specifically, within the group of customers that bring in substantial profits, CVN is not included.

![Picture13](https://github.com/antrinh1307/Power-BI-Project---Air-Export-Summary-of-a-Forwarder-March---April-2023-/assets/152482228/9873ddc5-2b7c-422b-a085-04a211261655)

--

When comparing the three customers, SDVN, YHV TB, and CVN, we can clearly see the peripheral factors. Despite having the lowest number of orders and chargeable weight (CW), YHV TB has a high profit margin, which helps place this customer in the top 6.

![Picture14](https://github.com/antrinh1307/Power-BI-Project---Air-Export-Summary-of-a-Forwarder-March---April-2023-/assets/152482228/0ea65a9f-1303-4f58-b9b2-953ba5a081af)

![Picture15](https://github.com/antrinh1307/Power-BI-Project---Air-Export-Summary-of-a-Forwarder-March---April-2023-/assets/152482228/6a42812c-0096-41ea-9315-b98e2209f841)

--

SEI is the customer with the highest number of canceled orders, totaling 4 orders.

The group of customers with predominantly canceled orders mainly consists of new or low-volume customers, whose revenue and profitability are not significant, such as MKAC, TAISHOO, JOHOKU, etc.

On the other hand, for big and regular customers who place frequent orders, there are still instances of canceled orders, such as CVN, YHV HP, CREYSN, etc. When the number of canceled orders reaches a certain threshold, it is important to investigate the reasons behind the cancellations in order to assess the causes and take appropriate measures to retain the customers.

![Picture16](https://github.com/antrinh1307/Power-BI-Project---Air-Export-Summary-of-a-Forwarder-March---April-2023-/assets/152482228/a91dc878-1d71-497e-84c5-723f4fb8fd6a)

## Carrier

Vietnam Airlines is not only the entity with the highest number of MAWB (Master Air Waybill) issued but also has the largest volume of transportation and shipping costs for the business.

![Picture17](https://github.com/antrinh1307/Power-BI-Project---Air-Export-Summary-of-a-Forwarder-March---April-2023-/assets/152482228/a0a6db64-4d8b-4a81-8a7c-6c3592a0d259)

Specifically, the number of MAWB issued by Vietnam Airlines accounts for more than 20% of the total number of shipments, while the volume of transportation and shipping costs also represent over 10% of the total volume of transportation and cost. This indicates that Vietnam Airlines is a significant business partner for the company.

![Picture18](https://github.com/antrinh1307/Power-BI-Project---Air-Export-Summary-of-a-Forwarder-March---April-2023-/assets/152482228/f3bd9735-fb6c-4f73-a1bb-c52a206999da)

Furthermore, Korean Air has a large number of destinations, primarily in the TC3 (Traffic Conference Area 3) region, followed by TC1 (Traffic Conference Area 1). These regions are known for handling significant cargo volumes, indicating that Korean Air is a trusted transportation partner chosen by the company for its shipments in recent times.

--

## Region

Among the three regions, TC3 has the highest profit based on the number of HAWB (House Air Waybill). There are times when the profit per shipment is nearly equal to the actual profit of the business. This demonstrates the strong influence of the TC3 region.

![Picture19](https://github.com/antrinh1307/Power-BI-Project---Air-Export-Summary-of-a-Forwarder-March---April-2023-/assets/152482228/c4a7ab3c-f0c5-4cc9-9c5d-28ad4296ece2)

The East Asia and Southeast Asia regions comprise a significant proportion of the destination for the company's shipments, with the exception of the United States market, which still holds the third-largest impact.

Thanks to its parent company in Japan, Yusen has been able to transfer a certain number of customers for the route from Vietnam to Japan.

Japan is a country that reaches 669.22 thousand kgs, accounting for over 40% of the total chargeable weight (CW), which is more than twice the figure for the US market, which stands at around 252.17 thousand kgs. Moreover, Japan possesses the largest customer base, which is twice as much as the number of customers in Thailand.

![Picture21](https://github.com/antrinh1307/Power-BI-Project---Air-Export-Summary-of-a-Forwarder-March---April-2023-/assets/152482228/eb51d4b2-0500-491a-8def-cd3e768e4a75)

## Tactic

### "Long-term strategy to increase the volume of cargo through Yusen"

Consolidated orders, especially those combining heavy and light cargo, will generate more profit.

![Picture22](https://github.com/antrinh1307/Power-BI-Project---Air-Export-Summary-of-a-Forwarder-March---April-2023-/assets/152482228/4d288848-beb6-459a-8b96-980a50319e48)

The transportation cost when applying consolidation of heavy and light cargo

        (total cost / total CW customer pay) = $350/(40+50) = $3.89


--

The volume of heavy cargo currently represents a small portion of the total volume of cargo passing through Yusen.

#### => The strategy is to find sources of heavy cargo to optimize costs and increase profitability.

#### 1: The airfreight cost when consolidating heavy and light cargo, if ideal, would be lower than the actual cost paid to the carrier.

- Proactively reducing selling prices for customers, especially those with high-density cargo (heavy goods).

- Increasing competitiveness with industry competitors to attract more cargo volume through Yusen.

#### 2: Once a stable cargo volume is established and there is a strong market presence, leverage can be exerted to negotiate lower rates with carriers.

#### WARNING: Accepting a loss in profit on House Airway Bills (HAWB) in the initial stage to increase cargo volume as well as future profitability.

### The pricing strategy aims not only to attract more heavy cargo but also to be applied to less active customers.

Firstly, it is necessary to work with customers to understand their shipment frequency and business situation:

For customers who only ship based on consignee requests or specific orders, the frequency and volume might be low. In this case, the goal is to retain them and become their sole preferred forwarder when they have shipment needs.
For customers with high order volumes and frequent shipments to serve production or continuous demand, proactive price reductions can be applied as a form of favoritism and encouragement for them to route additional cargo through Yusen. Large businesses with high shipment volumes often use services from multiple forwarders, so competition among forwarders is inevitable.

### By reducing prices for customers, the cargo volume increases, which facilitates the leverage to negotiate lower rates with carriers.

Using carriers that Yusen frequently utilizes means that as the cargo volume increases, Yusen can capture a significant proportion of the total outbound cargo volume handled by the carrier. This enables the feasibility of the pricing strategy (as a destination is not exclusively served by a single airline, airlines will compete to secure cargo). Therefore, with a stable and substantial cargo volume, Yusen can exert pressure on carriers to negotiate favorable rates.

### To attract new customers, 

It is important to identify regions with low cargo volume and compare them with the market (whether competitors in those regions have a high volume of cargo).

By comparing with the market, we can determine if competitors in those regions have a significant cargo volume.

Applying a promotional rate strategy, we can negotiate for bulk purchases from airlines (similar to wholesale purchasing, where buying in larger quantities results in lower costs) for specific regions that we want to focus on. For example, if we want to increase the volume of shipments to the United States, we can offer promotional rates on routes such as ORD, DFW, SFO, and so on.

#### NOTE: 
A promotion rate is a special pricing strategy where the rate is lower than the average market rate, and it may even be the lowest rate offered, aiming to attract customers with large cargo volumes to use fixed capacity which already secured by airlines.

The promotion rate is also particularly effective in attracting small and new customers, especially if they can provide a consistent source of shipments.
